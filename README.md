# Fingerprint-Attendance
This project is a fingerprint-based attendance system designed specifically for gym members, eliminating the need for physical membership cards. Members simply scan their fingerprint using a dedicated biometric device (e.g., Fingerspot), and their attendance is automatically recorded in the backend system.

The goal is to streamline the check-in process, enhance security, and prevent card misuse (e.g., sharing cards between members).
